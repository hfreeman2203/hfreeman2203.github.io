### CPSC 120

* Lab 6:

I really enjoyed the first part of this assignment, which was formatting user input to display a sandwich order. While I have done similar assignments before, this was the first one where all the input was done through terminal commands. This was a bit of a challenge for me as I am not used to working with terminal. But I enjoyed the challenge of figuring it out.

* Lab 8:

For assignment 8, me and my partner were tasked with calculating the average of five numbers. While removing the largest and smallest ones, and then taking the average of the remaining three. This assignment was a little difficult for me at first because while I've done this several times on paper, I've never had to implement it in code. But once we figured it out, it was very simple and I really enjoyed the whole project.

* Lab 9:

For part one on assignment 9 we were tasked with creating a spell checker. Which passes in words from a vector representing a dictionary, verifies that the words are in the dictionary, and are spelled correctly. Doing something like this was very unique, and I wasn’t sure what I typed would work. However, after working out a few minor kinks, everything ran correctly.
